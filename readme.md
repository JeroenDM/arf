# Acro Robotics Framework

Package inspired by an existing ROS package [descartes](https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/descartes).
I wrote this to learn C++ and MoveIt! and test ideas for motion planning.
In the future, if it actually works, I hope to contribute some of the new stuff back to descartes.

ACRO is the [research group](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/acro) where I work as a PhD student.
